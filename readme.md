# Sales Invoice Generator (SIG)

## üìå Project Overview

The **Sales Invoice Generator (SIG)** is a Java-based desktop application designed to help businesses generate, manage, and retain sales invoices efficiently. It enables users to create, view, update, and delete invoices, while keeping track of invoice items and totals. This tool is especially useful for small to medium-sized businesses for streamlined accounting and record-keeping.

## üìò What I Learned

Through developing the Sales Invoice Generator, I gained practical experience in:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Designed structured classes for `Invoice`, `InvoiceLine`, and data models.
- **GUI Development**: Created responsive desktop interfaces using **Java Swing**, including layouts, event listeners, and forms.
- **Data Management**: Implemented reading and writing operations for CSV files to simulate persistent storage.
- **MVC Architecture**: Structured the application using a clear Model-View-Controller pattern to separate concerns.
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Handled user actions via listeners and dynamic UI updates.
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Ensured robust handling of file operations, invalid inputs, and user interactions.
- **Project Planning**: Understood requirement analysis and UI alignment to functional specifications.
